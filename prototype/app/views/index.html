                Based on the assumptions and hypothesis generated at inception day and in line with the research

                Adding in guidance copy, content improvements: adding dummy provider name and UKPRN, updating content to
                ensure it meets basic gov.uk style guidelines, updating content to ensure it meets basic accessibility
                requirements, updating the presentation of funding numbers to ensure they meet known user needs

                Team agreement that we can already disprove the idea that the raw data is usable because it is not
                accessible and does not meet basic gov uk content standards, and so do not need to test all of the data
                in its raw form. Also, with Anoop back from AL, he was able to add in some missing content, such as
                guidance links.
              </li>
              <li>
